This repository is a source code for my final year project thesis titled Development of an Omni-directional Robotic Car with Human Tracking Mechanism. Key points of this project were the use of omni directional wheel to have a holonomic capability for robot to maneouvre in order to achieve better human tracking capacity.

Software logic of the system
(For Arduino, the completed code is "BT_MOTOR_MEGA_TEST_2017_3")
(For Python, the completed code is "main program.py")
